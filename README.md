# AI Agent Extension for VS Code

> 🤖 A lightweight AI coding assistant extension built on top of the VS Code fork, providing intelligent code completions and an interactive chat interface.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Code Completions**
- Intelligent code suggestions as you type
- Context-aware completions based on file content and cursor position
- Support for multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, etc.)
- Non-intrusive integration that works alongside existing IntelliSense

### 💬 **Interactive AI Chat Sidebar**
- Collapsible sidebar with AI assistant interface
- Ask questions about your code, get explanations, and request help
- File context awareness - the AI knows what you're working on
- Code insertion and editing capabilities directly from chat responses

### ⚡ **Lightweight & Modular**
- Fully isolated VS Code extension with no core editor modifications
- External AI agent backend for heavy lifting
- Easy to maintain and rebase-compatible with upstream VS Code
- Configurable API endpoints and completion settings

### 🔮 **Future-Ready Architecture**
- **Designed for integration with Loro cloud platform** - upcoming features will allow AI agents to provision, modify, and query cloud infrastructure directly from your editor
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Extensible plugin architecture for custom prompts and actions

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- Python (v3.8 or later)
- VS Code (v1.74 or later)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

2. **Start development environment:**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

3. **Link extension to VS Code:**
   ```bash
   make link
   ```

4. **Restart VS Code** to load the extension

### Alternative Quick Setup
```bash
# One-liner setup
make install && make dev

# In another terminal, link the extension
make link
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Code Completions

1. **Enable completions** (enabled by default):
   - Open VS Code settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
   - Search for "AI Agent"
   - Ensure "Enable Completions" is checked

2. **Trigger completions** by typing:
   - `.` (dot notation)
   - `(` (function calls)
   - `=` (assignments)
   - Or just start typing - completions appear automatically

3. **Customize completion behavior**:
   - `aiAgent.completionDelay`: Delay before showing suggestions (default: 500ms)
   - `aiAgent.maxCompletions`: Max number of suggestions (default: 5)

### AI Chat Interface

1. **Open the AI Assistant sidebar**:
   - Click the robot icon in the activity bar
   - Or use the command palette: `AI Agent: Open Chat`

2. **Start chatting**:
   - Type questions about your code
   - Ask for explanations or help with debugging
   - Request code examples or snippets

3. **Use file context**:
   - Open a file and select code
   - The AI will be aware of your current file and selection
   - Ask questions like "What does this function do?" or "How can I improve this code?"

### Commands

- `AI Agent: Open Chat` - Open the chat interface
- `AI Agent: Clear Chat History` - Clear conversation history
- `AI Agent: Toggle AI Completions` - Enable/disable completions

## 🧪 Testing Completions

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development environment: `make dev`
2. Open a Python file in VS Code
3. Type `print.` and wait for AI suggestions
4. Try typing `def my_function():` and press Enter

### API Testing
```bash
# Test completions endpoint
make test-completions

# Test chat endpoint
make test-chat

# Check backend health
make health
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Make Targets

```bash
make help          # Show all available commands
make dev           # Start development environment (agent + extension watch)
make build         # Build extension for production
make agent         # Start AI agent backend only
make install       # Install all dependencies
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
make test          # Run tests
make lint          # Run linting checks
make link          # Symlink extension to VS Code
make unlink        # Remove extension symlink
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   This starts:
   - AI agent backend on `http://localhost:8000`
   - TypeScript compiler in watch mode

2. **Link extension for testing:**
   ```bash
   make link
   ```

3. **Make changes and test:**
   - Extension changes: TypeScript recompiles automatically
   - Backend changes: Restart with `Ctrl+C` and `make agent`
   - VS Code: Reload window (`Cmd/Ctrl + R`)

4. **Debug:**
   - Extension: Use VS Code's built-in debugger (F5)
   - Backend: Check logs in terminal or visit `http://localhost:8000/health`

### Configuration

Extension settings in VS Code:
```json
{
  "aiAgent.apiEndpoint": "http://localhost:8000",
  "aiAgent.enableCompletions": true,
  "aiAgent.completionDelay": 500,
  "aiAgent.maxCompletions": 5
}
```

Backend configuration via environment variables:
```bash
PORT=8000                    # Server port
LOG_LEVEL=info              # Logging level
```

## 🎨 Extending Prompts and Actions

### Custom Chat Actions

To add new actions that appear in chat responses, modify the backend `process_chat_message` method in `agent/app.py`:

```python
actions.append({
    "type": "custom_action",
    "label": "Run Tests",
    "data": {"command": "npm test"}
})
```

Then handle the action in the frontend `webview-ui/main.js` and extension `src/webview.ts`.

### Custom Completion Providers

Add language-specific completions by modifying the `AgentBackend` class in `agent/app.py`:

```python
def _get_custom_language_completions(self, request: CompletionRequest):
    # Add your custom completion logic
    return [CompletionSuggestion(...)]
```

2. Check Python dependencies: `cd agent && source venv/bin/activate && pip list`
3. Review backend logs in the terminal

### Completions Not Working
1. Check extension settings: `aiAgent.enableCompletions`
2. Verify API endpoint: `aiAgent.apiEndpoint`
3. Test the completions endpoint: `make test-completions`

### Chat Interface Not Responding
1. Check WebSocket connection in browser dev tools
2. Verify backend is accepting connections
3. Clear chat history and try again
